                            The project was born out of a need to build something real and useful during my semester break. After experimenting with Firebase and Supabase, I moved to a custom MERN stack setup to have more control and flexibility. The goal is to offer a lightweight, scalable system that mimics real-world exam environments and helps me grow as a full-stack developer.
